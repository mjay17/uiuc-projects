			<h1>About the Visualization</h1>
			<p>This visualization is an interactive slideshow which takes the user through the Dataset of the 9th Round of the Yelp Academic 
				Dataset Challenge. The dataset itself contains the Yelp reviews and aggregated check-ins over time of 144 thousand businesses 
				located throughout various metropolitans across the globe. This visualization focuses on the data from the United States which 
				includes the following cities: Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Urbana-Champaign, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Madison, Cleveland.</p>
			<h2>Recommended Settings</h2>
			<p>As the visualizations use a preset static canvas of 1024x768 pixels, the viewing size of the interactive visualization is at 
				least 1280x800 pixels to accommodate the surrounding text and scene elements.</p>
			<h2>Managing the Dataset</h2>
			<p>With such a large dataset, creating a visualization with the raw data turned out to be very difficult. The first step for created 
				this visualization was to process the dataset and focus on the data pertaining restaurants in the United States only.</p>
			<h2>Templates Scene</h2>
			<p>The use of CSS and FullPage.js allows for a cohesive template look for the interactive visualization. Each page is transitioned 
				using the same method and text elements are kept the same (font size and family). Additionally there is a page navigation bar 
				on the right side which allows users to skip between different slides. The tooltips which are triggered when a user moves their 
				mouse over the navigation alters the display parameters for each navigation menu item.</p>
			<h2>Annotations</h2>
			<p>Annotations have been used in all three visualizations with a similar process of using triggers to change the hidden paramenter of 
				the annotation. For example, the Line Chart Visualization has an initial state of the hidden parameter which controls the display 
				of the annotations set to false. As a user uses the brush bar to trigger changes to the line chart visualization x-axis 
				parameters, it also changes this hidden parameter to true. In turn the annotations disappear until the user resets the brush bar 
				to zero - thus zooming out back to the default visualization parameters.</p>
			<h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
			<p>Both parameters and triggers are used in all of the three visualizations. For the Bubble Chart Visualization, parameters for the 
				x,y co-ordinates of each bubble are set to an initial central position for the All Reviews Visualization. As a user selects menu 
				items to chose between All Reviews, Reviews by State and Reviews by Stars, it triggers the change of bubble’s x,y co-ordinates 
				parameter to their respective groupings.</p><br />
			<p>In Zoomable Sunburst Visualization, each mouse click on a region is a trigger for the path and arc parameters. By clicking within 
				a region, you can zoom into the data to take a look at the information underneath. Clicking the centre circle will trigger the 
				parameters to return to its values one up in the hierarchy.</p><br />
			<p>For Line Chart Visualization, parameters are set for each Restaurant Category. These parameters are triggered to be updated as the 
				mouse moves over the visualization, providing the user with a snapshot of the amount of check-ins in a given time. A secondary 
				parameter and trigger set is the brush bar below the line chart. This bar allows the user to zoom into the data to show a closer 
				look of the data. By clicking a set space on the brush bar, it triggers the x-axis parameter of the line chart to be updated to a 
				ratio of the same selected section of the brush bar.</p>

			<h1>The Yelp Dataset</h1>
			<p>​​The restaurant business is an enormous industry where understanding your clients and their behavioural patterns may give prospective 
				new restaurant owners a much needed head start. This interactive slideshow dives into the publicly available Yelp Academic Dataset 
				which includes a large set of reviews client interactions across multiple industries and regions. We will focus on restaurants within 
				the United States in order to better understand client interactions.</p><br />
			<p>Assumptions are made in the positive correlation between the number of reviews and the popularity of a business. This is then tied with 
				the assumption of the positive correlation between number of check-ins and the popularity of a business. By focusing on restaurants 
				which have large number of reviews, check-ins and high star rating, we will be able to understand the type of restaurant to invest 
				into.</p>
